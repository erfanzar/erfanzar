- Objd: A super-fast and lightweight object detection model that utilizes a similar architecture to the popular YOLO family of models. Objd can rapidly identify objects in real-world images and videos, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of industries and applications. With a focus on speed and agility, Objd is designed to work seamlessly on resource-constrained devices, enabling it to be deployed in a variety of edge computing environments.
