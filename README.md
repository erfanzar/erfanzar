- 👋 Hi, I’m @erfanzar
- 👀 I like to train deep neural nets on large datasets 🧠.
  Among other things in this world:)
<!-- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improve my skill on deep learning and ai more and more i been learning and searching for this topic for 2 years
-   and i invented some kind of NN (neural Network) for my self and some kind of reseach they aren't fast enought and they'r only work with L1Loss or MseLoss
-   functions but im still trying to develop them they'r acctually working nice on some topics like patern finding some kind of mixing Rnn and Cnn Together
-   and finaly i have created an object detection library but i think im the only one who use it (work with 70 accuracy and 40 fps on rtx 2080 ti :| ) -->
